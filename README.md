Assignment 3: City Transportation Network Optimization (MST)Project OverviewThis project implements the two classical greedy algorithms‚ÄîPrim's and Kruskal's‚Äîto solve the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem. The goal is to optimize a city's transportation network by finding the minimum set of roads required to connect all city districts while minimizing the total construction cost.An extensive Analytical Report (Ass3_report.docx) is included, comparing the efficiency (time and operations) of both algorithms based on empirical data collected from multiple test cases.üõ†Ô∏è Technology StackLanguage: Java 11+Build Tool: Apache MavenTesting: JUnit 5Data Handling: Google Gson (for JSON I/O)üìÇ Project StructureFile / FolderPurposesrc/main/java/Contains the core implementation files (Prim.java, Kruskal.java, Main.java) and the OOP Graph Structure (Graph.java, Edge.java).pom.xmlMaven configuration file, including dependencies (Gson, JUnit) and build settings.assign_3_input.jsonInput Data: Six weighted, undirected graphs used for testing.output.jsonOutput Data: Detailed MST results (edges, total cost) for all test cases.results.csvAnalysis Data: Summary table of performance metrics (Time (ms), Operations) used in the report.Ass3_report.docxAnalytical Report: Full comparison of algorithm efficiency (theory vs. practice) and conclusions.‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Execution1. RequirementsYou must have JDK (Java Development Kit) 11 or higher and Apache Maven installed on your system.2. Build the ProjectNavigate to the project's root directory and compile the source code using Maven:Bashmvn clean install
3. Run the ApplicationExecute the main class to run both algorithms on all graphs defined in assign_3_input.json. This command will generate the output files (output.json and results.csv):Bashmvn exec:java
4. Run Unit TestsTo verify the functional correctness of the MST algorithms, run the JUnit tests:Bashmvn test
üìä Key FindingsImplementation (Bonus)The project uses an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach, defining custom classes:Edge.java to model road segments (with from, to, and weight).Graph.java to manage the collection of nodes and Edge objects.Performance ComparisonThe analysis of the sparse test graphs ($E \approx V$) revealed:Correctness: Both Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms produced identical Minimum Spanning Tree Costs for all six test cases.Operations: Kruskal's Algorithm performed a significantly higher number of internal operations due to the time complexity dominated by the initial sorting of all edges.Speed: Prim's Algorithm (implemented with a Priority Queue) demonstrated a slightly faster execution time on larger, sparse graphs, making it the recommended algorithm for this transportation network scenario.This project successfully meets all requirements of Assignment 3, including the bonus section for custom graph data structure implementation.
